 * Description: This operation is used as the first operation when the Initiator wishes to send an
 * object to the Responder. This operation sends an ObjectInfo dataset from the Initiator to
 * the Responder. All the fields in this ObjectInfo dataset are from the perspective of the
 * Initiator, meaning that the StorageID, for example, would be interpreted as the StorageID
 * of the store in which the object resides on the Initiator before being sent to the
 * Responder. This operation is sent prior to the SendObject operation, described in Clause
 * 10.4.13, in order to inform the Responder about the properties of the object that it
 * intends to send later, and to effectively ask permission whether the object can be sent to
 * the Responder. A response of OK infers that the receiver can accept the object, and
 * serves to inform the sender that it may now issue a SendObject operation for the object.
 * The first parameter is optionally used to indicate the store on the Responder into which
 * the object should be stored. If this parameter is specified, and the Responder will not be
 * able to store the object in the indicated store, the operation should fail, and the
 * appropriate response, such as Specification_Of_Destination_Unsupported,
 * Store_Not_Available, Store_Read_Only, or Store_Full should be used. If this parameter
 * is unused, it should be set to 0x00000000, and the Responder shall decide in which store
 * to place the object, be that a Responder-determined default location, or the location with
 * the most room (or possibly the only location with enough room).
 * The second parameter is optionally used to indicate where on the indicated store the
 * object should be placed (i.e. the association/folder that the object should become a child
 * of.) If this parameter is used, the first parameter must also be used. If the receiver is
 * unable to place the object as a child of the indicated second parameter, the operation
 * should fail. If the problem with the attempted specification is the general inability of the
 * receiving device to allow the specification of destination, the response
 * Specification_of_Destination_Unsupported should be sent. This response infers that the
 * Initiator should not try to specify a destination location in future invocations of
 * SendObjectInfo, as all attempts at such specification will fail. If the problem is only
 * with the particular destination specified, the Invalid_ObjectHandle or
 * Invalid_ParentObject response should be used, depending on whether the ObjectHandle
 * did not refer to a valid object, or whether the indicated object is a valid object but is not
 * an association. If the root directory of the indicated store is desired, the second
 * parameter should be set to 0xFFFFFFFF. If this parameter is unused, it should be set to
 * 0x00000000, and the Responder shall decide where in the indicated store the object is to
 * be placed. If neither the first nor the second parameter is used, the Responder shall
 * decide both which store to place the object in as well as where to place it within that
 * store.
 * If the Responder agrees that the object may be sent, it is required to retain this
 * ObjectInfo dataset until the next SendObject or SendObjectInfo operation is performed
 * subsequently within the session. If the SendObjectInfo operation succeeds, and the next
 * occurring SendObject operation does not return a successful response, the
 * SendObjectInfo held by the Responder shall be retained in case the Initiator wishes to re-
 * attempt the SendObject operation for that previously successful SendObjectInfo
 * operation. If the Initiator wishes to resend the ObjectInfo dataset before attempting to
 * resend the object it may do so. Successful completion of the SendObjectInfo operation
 * conveys that the Responder possesses a copy of the ObjectInfo and that the Responder
 * has allocated space for the incoming data object. Any other response code other than
 * OK indicates that the Responder has not retained the ObjectInfo dataset, and that the
 * object should not attempt to be sent.
 * For a particular session, the receiving device shall only retain one ObjectInfo that is the
 * result of a SendObjectInfo operation in memory at a time. If another SendObjectInfo
 * operation occurs before a SendObject operation, the new ObjectInfo shall replace the
 * previously held one. If this occurs, any storage space or memory space reserved for the
 * object described in the overwritten ObjectInfo dataset should be freed before overwriting
 * and allocation of the resources for the new ObjectInfo dataset.
 * The first response parameter of this operation should be set to the StorageID that the
 * Responder will store the object into if it sent. The second response parameter of this
 * operation should be set to the Parent ObjectHandle of the association that the object
 * becomes a child of. If the object is stored in the root of the store, this parameter should
 * be set to 0xFFFFFFFF.
 * If the Initiator wishes to retain associations and/or hierarchies on the Responder for the
 * objects it is sending, then the objects should be sent top down, starting with the highest
 * level of the hierarchy, proceeding in either a depth-first or breadth-first fashion down the
 * hierarchy tree. The Initiator shall use the Responder’s newly assigned ObjectHandle in
 * the third response parameter for the ParentObject that is returned in the SendObjectInfo
 * response as the second operation parameter for a child’s SendObjectInfo operation.

 * first parameter. If the StorageID is 0x00000000, the object(s) will be stored in a store
 * that is determined by the capturing device. If the particular store specified is not
 * available, or no store is specified and there are no stores available, this operation should
 * return Store_Not_Available.
 * The capturing of new data objects is an asynchronous operation. This operation may be
 * used to capture images or any type of data that can be fully captured using a single
 * operation trigger. For these types of captures, the length of the capture and the number
 * of objects to capture is known apriori by the Responder, as opposed to being
 * dynamically terminable after capture initiation by the Initiator. A separate operation,
 * InitiateOpenCapture, described in Clause 10.4.28, can be used to support dynamically
 * controlled captures that are terminable by the Initiator.
 * If the ObjectFormatCode in the second operation parameter is 0x00000000, the device
 * shall capture an image in the format that is the default for the device. A successful
 * response to an InitiateCapture operation indicates the Responder’s acceptance of the
 * InitiateCapture operation, and not the completion status of the actual object capture,
 * which is indicated using the CaptureComplete event.
 * As the capture is executed, one or more new data objects should be created on the
 * device. The number of objects to be captured is not specified as part of the
 * InitiateCapture operation, but is determined by the state of the capturing device, and may
 * optionally be set by the Initiator using an appropriate DeviceProperty. As each of the
 * newly captured objects becomes available, the Responder is required to send an
 * ObjectAdded event to the Initiator, indicating the ObjectHandle that is assigned to each
 * as described in Clause 12.5.2. This ObjectAdded event shall contain the TransactionID
 * of the InitiateCapture operation with which it is associated. If, at any time, the store
 * becomes full, the device shall invoke a Store_Full event, which shall contain the
 * TransactionID of the InitiateCapture operation that failed to cause a new object to be

 * separately, so any object captured before the store becomes full should be retained.
 * When all objects have been captured, the Responder shall send a CaptureComplete event
 * to the Initiator. If the Store_Full event was issued, the CaptureComplete event should
 * not be issued. If another capture is occurring when this operation is invoked, the
 * Device_Busy response should be used.

 * represent maximum size as opposed to actual size. This operation is not necessary for
 * objects of type Association, as objects of this type are fully qualified by their ObjectInfo
 * dataset.
 * The operation behaves exactly like GetObject, except that the second and third

 * Invalid_TransactionID, Invalid_StorageID, Store_Full, Invalid_ObjectFormatCode,
 * Invalid_Parameter, Store_Not_Available, Invalid_Code_Format, Device_Busy,
 * Description: Causes the device to initiate the capture of one or more new data objects
 * according to its current device properties, storing the data into the store indicated by the
 * StorageID. If the StorageID is 0x00000000, the object(s) will be stored in a store that is
 * determined by the capturing device. If the particular store specified is not available, or
 * no store is specified and there are no stores available, this operation should return
 * Store_Not_Available.
 * The capturing of new data objects is an asynchronous operation. This operation may be
 * used to implement an Initiate/Terminate mechanism to capture one or more objects over
 * an Initiator-controlled time period, such as a single long still exposure, a series of stills,
 * audio capture, etc. Whether the time period controls the time of capture for a single
 * object or the number of fixed-time objects that are captured is determined by the
 * Responder, and may be a function of the ObjectFormat as well as any appropriate
 * DeviceProperties.
 * A separate operation, InitiateCapture, can be used to
 * support captures that do not require the Initiator to indicate when the capture should
 * terminate.
 * If the ObjectFormatCode in the second operation parameter is 0x00000000, the device
 * shall capture an image in the format that is the default for the device. A successful
 * response to an InitiateOpenCapture operation indicates the Responder’s acceptance of
 * the InitiateOpenCapture operation, and not the completion status of the capture
 * operation.
 * A successful response to the InitiateOpenCapture operation implies that the Responder
 * has started to capture one or more objects. When the Initiator wishes to terminate the
 * capture, it is required to send a TerminateOpenCapture operation. The CaptureComplete
 * event is not used for this operation, as the end of the capture period is determined by the
 * Initiator. As each of the newly captured objects becomes available, the Responder is
 * required to send an ObjectAdded event to the Initiator, indicating the ObjectHandle that
 * is assigned to each. The ObjectAdded event shall contain
 * the TransactionID of the InitiateOpenCapture operation with which it is associated. If, at
 * any time, the store becomes full, the device shall issue a Store_Full event, which shall
 * contain the TransactionID of the InitiateOpenCapture operation that failed to cause a
 * new object to be stored. In the case of multiple objects being captured, each object shall
 * be treated separately, so any object captured before the store becomes full should be
 * retained. Whether or not an object that was partially captured can be retained and used is
 * a function of the device’s behavior and object format. For example, if the device runs
 * out of room while capturing a video clip, it may be able to save the portion that it had
 * room to store. Any object that is retained in these situations should cause an
 * ObjectAdded event to be issued, while any object that is not retained should cause no
 * event to be issued. A Store_Full event effectively terminates the capture, and in these
 * cases, issuing the TerminateOpenCapture operation is not used. If another object capture
 * is occurring when this operation is invoked, the Device_Busy response should be used.
